# Pera Wallet

## Overview
Welcome to the code that powers Pera Wallet! This repo will always contain the source code for the latest publicly available Pera Wallet version (official download links can be found at [perawallet.app](https://perawallet.app)). We want to make sure that we focus not only on great features and experiences but also security, transparency, and community involvement.

Other than version numbers changing, news and other important release information (like release notes) will not be posted here. To stay up to date on the latest news, features, release notes, tutorials, and more, please check out [perawallet.app](https://perawallet.app).

## Contributing
While the Algorand community is always welcome to contribute, please note that new feature development happens outside of this repo which means that open issues/PRs might not see a lot of activity. We do this in order to make sure that all code that is pushed here has passed our rigorous QA testing and high security standards. That being said, weâ€™ll do our best to take note of feature requests or additions - some of which we might potentially incorporate into our codebase via our main development pipeline. 

If you simply need help, want to report a bug, or want to suggest a feature, the best place to do so is via our community channels:
